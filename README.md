# ClearbitCorrect
ClearbitCorrect is a wrapper for the Clearbit API that uses NLP and text processing techniques to standardize and correct company names before they are sent to the Clearbit API for logo retrieval. This project helps to ensure that the correct company logo is returned even when the input company name is an alias or has typographical errors.
